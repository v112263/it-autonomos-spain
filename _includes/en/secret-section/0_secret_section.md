## Secret section

Thank you for checking out this section. I'm glad the document turned out to be useful for you. I put a lot of effort
into creating it and constantly update the information to keep it relevant and helpful.

Let me briefly tell you how this document came to be.

For the last few years, I’ve had a habit of documenting all the complex bureaucratic processes I encounter in my
personal knowledge base. This helps me save time when I have to deal with the same task again in the future. One of the
hardest things for me was everything related to autónomo. Before I registered it, I gathered a lot of information from
my friends, chats, and webinars.
Later, I thought that my notes might be useful to others as well. That's how this document became publicly available.

A little about myself. I'm a Java Developer and Java Team Lead, with over 10 years in the IT field. Some notable
achievements include winning the Malta Blockchain Summit Hackathon in 2018 (we took first place with our team). I love
reading books and would gladly chat about this topic in person. Also, I love cycling.

If you'd like to thank me for the work I’ve done:
