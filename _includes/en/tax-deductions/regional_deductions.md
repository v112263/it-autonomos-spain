## Regional deductions

Regional deductions are tax deductions established by the autonomous communities of Spain and may vary depending on the
region. These can be used by taxpayers residing in the relevant region if their annual income does not exceed the
established limits. For example, in Valencia, for many deductions, the annual income should not exceed 30,000 euros for
individual declarations and 50,000 euros for joint declarations. These limits and types of deductions may vary by
region.

Regional deductions can only be applied when submitting the [annual declaration (Renta)](#annual-declaration-renta).
