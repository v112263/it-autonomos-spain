## Reducción por inicio de una actividad económica

New autónomos (those who have not previously conducted autónomo activity in Spain or similar activities in other
countries) or those who have conducted unprofitable activities can qualify for a 20% reduction in the taxable IRPF base
in the first two years. This reduction does not apply if more than 50% of income in the tax period comes from an
individual or organization from which employment income was received in the previous year. The maximum amount to which
the reduction applies is 100,000 euros per year.

To apply this discount, you need to discuss it with your gestor or Xolo when submitting the [annual tax declaration](#annual-declaration-renta).
