## Calculation base for social contributions (Base de cotización)

Base de cotización is the calculation base for [social security contributions](#social-contributions-seguridad-social).

During the first 12 months after autonomo registration, a [reduced rate](#risk-of-losing-the-seguridad-social-discount)
applies for social security contributions.

If in the first year the autonomo's income was above the minimum wage in Spain (approximately 17,000 euros per year),
then starting from the 13th month you will pay social security contributions at the regular rate depending on your
income.

You need to choose the base de cotización yourself within the limits allowed for your income level. The monthly
quota is calculated from this base, and your future benefits and pension are also calculated based on this same base.

The base de cotización can be changed up to 6 times per year. The new base takes effect every two months: from March 1 /
May 1 / July 1 / September 1 / November 1 / January 1.

**How to change the base de cotización**

1. Go to the
   link [Modificación de datos de autónomos](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/Categorias/Altas,+bajas+y+modificaciones/Bajas+y+modificaciones/ModDatosAutonomos){:
   target="_blank"}
2. Solicitar modificación -> Log into the system (for example, using
   a [digital certificate](#obtaining-a-digital-certificate)) -> Cuota y cotización -> Modificar.
3. Enter your monthly income (exact formula can be found
   in [the calculator](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/tramites/simuladorRETAPublico){:
   target="_blank"}).
4. Choose the monthly quota (you can select the minimum), this amount you will pay every month. Also,
   the quota size affects your future pension and benefits.

   **Important:** On the base selection page, focus on the range at the top (for example, "Tramo de bases de cotización:
   1.928,10 € - 4.909,50 €") - this is your allowed range. Below the slider it shows "MIN 653,59 €/mes" - this is the
   system's absolute minimum for the lowest tramo, not your minimum. Choose the base strictly within the range shown at
   the top. It's easier to enter the number manually in the field above the slider: for example, for the minimum quota
   in tramo 1.928,10-4.909,50 € enter 1.928,10 €, not 653,59 €.
5. Firmar y confirmar.

The amount in the "Base de cotización" field is not what will be debited from your account. The actual quota is
approximately 31% of the base.

**What if during the year income changed, but you didn't change the base de cotización?**

If income decreased during the year, and you overpaid for Seguridad Social - the refund will be made automatically after
the annual reconciliation with the tax authority.

If income increased during the year, and you underpaid for Seguridad Social - you will receive a resolution with the
amount and payment deadline (approximately 1 month). This payment must be made manually. If you miss the deadline,
there will be a penalty of up to 20%.
