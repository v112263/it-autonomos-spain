## Social contributions (Seguridad Social)

Social contributions (Seguridad Social) are necessary to ensure access to state social services and protection
(healthcare, future pension, etc.). They must be paid regardless of income. Even if you don’t have clients, you are
obliged to continue paying contributions while searching for new ones.

### First-year discount

Be sure to read about [the risk of losing the discount](#risk-of-losing-the-seguridad-social-discount).

During the first year, there is a discount, and the contribution amounts to €87.61 per month. After 12 months from the
registration of an autónomo, the contribution amount increases and depends on your income. More details can be found
here: [Calculadora de cuotas para autónomos](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/tramites/simuladorRETAPublico){:

If your income in the previous fiscal year did not exceed the minimum subsistence level, the discount (tarifa plana) can
be extended for another 12 months. You must apply in advance, preferably two months before the end of the first year of
the discount. If your income exceeds the minimum subsistence level in the following year, you will have to cancel the
discount and start paying the full amount. The maximum duration of the discount is 24 months from the date of autónomo
registration.

If you close your autónomo within 12 months of registration, you will not be able to reactivate the discount for 3
years.

### Deduction of social contributions

1. The bank account for deductions must be in your name and associated with your NIE (not passport). When registering an
   autónomo, it’s possible to specify someone else’s account (e.g., your spouse’s), but it is advisable to avoid this
   unless necessary.
2. The SS payment invoice is generated on the 14th of each month, with deductions made on the last working day of each
   month.
3. If the autónomo registration occurs in the second half of the month, the contribution will be charged at the end of
   the following month as a single payment for the days of the current month and the entire next month. For example,
   registering on September 20 means payment at the end of October for 10 days of September and the full month of
   October.
4. If registration happens after the 1st of the month, the first payment will be proportionally reduced (e.g., mid-month
   registration will result in a charge of about €43.33).
5. In case of technical delays in registration, payment may be charged later. For instance, if you applied in the first
   half of the month but completed registration in the second half, the payment will be taken at the end of the
   following month for the current and next full month. This has been reported in our chat, so do not worry.
6. In rare cases, the contribution for the first month after registering as an autónomo may be deducted with a
   significant delay - up to 2 months later (I personally know of several such cases). If you encounter such a
   situation, I recommend contacting your gestor/Xolo and following the steps outlined below. Most likely, everything
   will resolve itself, but it's better to be cautious.  
   Example of such a rare case:
    - The autónomo is registered in the first half of November.
    - At the end of November, the SS deduction for November does not occur.
    - In December, the contribution for December is deducted, but the deduction for part of November still does not
      happen.
    - At the end of January, deductions are made for both January and November.

### What to do if the SS payment fails

1. **Contact your gestor for immediate assistance.** Gestors can take action to avoid penalties.
2. Check
   the [Seguridad Social portal](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/Categorias/Consulta+de+pagos+y+deudas/ConsultaRecibos){:
   target="_blank"} for invoices. If invoices are absent, there is no debt.
3. If an invoice is on the portal but the payment wasn’t charged, contact your bank to check if a direct debit attempt
   was made.
4. Update your IBAN
   in [Seguridad Social's personal account](https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Ciudadanos/cotizacion/202115){:
   target="_blank"}. Note that updating the account is not immediate, and the next payment may still be charged to the
   old account.
5. Check
   for [notifications from Seguridad Social](https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Inicio/NotificacionesTelematicas/){:
   target="_blank"} to ensure there are no issues. Notifications can be delayed by up to two months.
