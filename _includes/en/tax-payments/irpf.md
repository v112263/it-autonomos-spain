## IRPF (income tax)

IRPF (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas) is a personal income tax in Spain. The tax is progressive,
meaning the rate increases with higher income levels.

IRPF is divided into two main categories:

- Tax on autónomo income (from 19% to 47%) - applies to income from professional or entrepreneurial activities.
- Capital gains tax (from 19% to 28%) - applies to income from asset sales or investments.

The tax is calculated based on net profit (after deducting all permitted expenses).

### Progressive scale and rates

IRPF rates may vary depending on Spain's autonomous community and can change annually.

Approximate table (find the current one in official sources):

- Up to €12,450: 19%
- From €12,451 to €20,200: 24%
- From €20,201 to €35,200: 30%
- From €35,201 to €60,000: 37%
- From €60,001 to €300,000: 45%
- Over €300,000: 47%

Each taxpayer has a non-taxable minimum, which depends on personal circumstances, such as family composition. On
average, the first €8000-€9000 of income are tax-free. If, for example, annual income is €12,000, the 19% tax rate
will only apply to the remaining €3,000 (€12,000 - €9,000 = €3,000).

A progressive tax rate means that as your income increases, a higher tax rate applies to the corresponding income
segment. For example, if your annual income is €50,000, the tax is calculated as follows:

- The first €12,450 is taxed at 19% (note the non-taxable minimum mentioned above)
- Income from €12,451 to €20,200 is taxed at 24%
- Income from €20,201 to €35,200 is taxed at 30%
- Income from €35,201 to €50,000 is taxed at 37%

### IRPF payment

1. In case of any problems with IRPF payment, contact your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) immediately for assistance.
2. For autónomos, the tax is automatically debited from the bank account every quarter on the 20th of April, July,
   October, and (in January, the debit day differs) at a rate of 20% of income. For direct debit to work, it is
   important to submit [quarterly returns](#quarterly-declarations) on time. If the 20th falls on a weekend, the deduction will be postponed to the
   next business day. The exact calendar is available on
   the [tax office website](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/Bibl_virtual/folletos/calendario_contribuyente.shtml){:

3. You can pay the tax manually (and even more than 20%), but this may come with additional challenges, so it is
   recommended to use the standard scheme.
4. If there are insufficient funds at the time of the tax deduction, you may be fined.
5. After submitting the [annual return](#annual-declaration-renta), a recalculation is performed: if there was an underpayment of IRPF, you will need
   to pay the difference, and in the case of an overpayment, the excess will be refunded.
