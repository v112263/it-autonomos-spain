## Additional (recommended)

What follows is not mandatory, but I highly recommend it. Some points relate to benefits you receive as an
autónomo. If you pay taxes, why not take advantage of these benefits?

1. Subscribe to the Telegram channel [Autonomo & SL](https://bit.ly/autonomo-and-sl-channel){:target="_blank"} - 
   stay on top of important updates and get practical insights regularly.
2. Close a similar economic activity to Autónomo in another country, if it exists (for example, FOP in Ukraine).
    - It is advisable to consult a specialist to determine whether this should be done before or after registering the
      autónomo. Based on the experience of many, I can say that it would be logical to close such an economic activity
      in another country.
3. Download the document with your social security number (NSS) -
   [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
   target="_blank"} (I recommend downloading it just in case you need to present this document somewhere).
4. Familiarize yourself with the [annual declaration filing process](#annual-declaration-renta). This is mandatory, but not urgent - it will become relevant at the beginning of the next year after registering your autónomo.
5. [Obtain a plastic SIP card for yourself](#obtaining-a-plastic-sip-for-yourself).
6. [Obtain plastic SIP cards for family members](#obtaining-a-plastic-sip-for-family-members).
7. Read about [my experience getting a mortgage as an autónomo](/en/mortgage/) (8 months after registration) - if you're planning to get a mortgage in the future, my experience might be useful for you.
