## Registration (basic)

1. Obtain a residence permit with the right to work (for example, Digital Nomad, Cuenta Propia, etc.). I recommend
   contacting [reliable immigration lawyers](#reliable-immigration-lawyers) for help with obtaining one.
2. Choose a [method of registration and management for autónomo](#preparation-for-registering-as-autónomo).
3. Prepare [all necessary documents](#necessary-documents-for-registering-an-autónomo).
4. [Open a bank account](#bank-account-for-autónomo).
5. Submit the application for autónomo registration.
   - [Instructions for gestor](#registration-of-autónomo-gestor).
   - [Instructions for Xolo](#registration-of-autónomo-xolo).
6. Wait for confirmation letters and SMS from the tax authorities and social security (1-2 days).

*<u>Once these steps are completed, your autónomo is successfully registered, and you can start economic activity.</u>*
