# Preparation for registering as Autónomo

To register and manage an autónomo, you can choose between two popular options: a [gestor](#reliable-gestors) or
the [Xolo](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="_blank"} service.

Personally, I have extensive experience using both options - both gestor services and Xolo services. I can confidently say that both of these options are good, and you can choose the one you prefer.

Before choosing one of the options, I recommend reading the sections about the [gestor](#gestor-1) (especially
the [criteria for a reliable gestor](#criteria-for-a-reliable-gestor)) and about [Xolo](#xolo-1).

## Gestor

[Gestor](#reliable-gestors) is a specialist in accounting and taxes who provides personalized support to autónomo in matters of reporting,
interaction with the tax authorities, and solving non-standard situations.

- Supports [autónomo colaborador](#autónomo-colaborador).
- Personal communication and individual consultations.
- Ability to discuss non-standard situations.
- All communication with tax authorities and other services is handled by the gestor.
- [Takes responsibility](#gestors-liability) for errors in reporting.
- Does not require providing your [digital certificate](#providing-a-digital-certificate-to-the-gestor).
- ⚠️ Sometimes it can be difficult to find a professional and responsible gestor.
- ⚠️ Subscription is usually more expensive than the service.
- ⚠️ Registration for autónomo and EU VAT is usually paid.

_If you are looking for a good gestor, check out the [reliable gestors section](#reliable-gestors). And if you're
already working with a gestor but are dissatisfied, see the [instructions for changing a gestor](#changing-the-gestor)._
