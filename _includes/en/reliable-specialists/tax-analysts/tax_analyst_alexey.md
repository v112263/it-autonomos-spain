Alexey calculates the tax burden in Spain for autonomo, autonomo + colaborador and SL - and helps choose the structure with the lowest tax burden. He does not handle accounting or file tax returns - he helps you understand the numbers and make the right decision. The result is a [detailed report with charts](https://bit.ly/tax-analysis-report-en){:target="_blank"} showing the difference between options in specific numbers.

When calculating for autonomo and colaborador, many variables are involved: social contributions and benefits for both, optimal salary, changes in discounts over several years ahead. He calculates all these scenarios and compares them with the SL option, so you can see what works best for your income.

By primary profession, Alexey is a programmer who has been working in analytics since 2011. He developed his own analytical model, the logic of which he has verified and refined together with gestors. He has been doing tax calculations in Spain since 2023. Accuracy is verified in practice - the variance with actual tax returns is less than 0.5% (typically within 20-40 euros).

Alexey also reviews already filed tax returns. A real example: a client's annual tax return resulted in an additional payment of 1,500 euros. He reviewed the calculation and found a deduction that the gestor had not applied. After filing a corrective return, the tax authority refunded the client 1,000 euros.
