Tatiana handles accounting and tax services for autónomos and SLs across all industries: from IT freelancers to beauty salons, from interior designers to tourism and real estate rental companies. Her experience in finance and banking dates back to 2011, including work with large corporate businesses.

Her approach is proactive. Tatiana analyzes each case and suggests ways to optimize the tax base rather than simply waiting for client requests. The autónomo service fee includes consultations and processing of up to 50 invoices per quarter. All clients sign a contract outlining the details of cooperation.

Beyond accounting, the company handles legal matters: advising on local laws, reviewing and drafting contracts, and representing clients before authorities. Tatiana works in a team with immigration lawyer José - this allows solving complex tasks in one place. For clients with residence permits, there's an additional benefit: before registering as autónomo or SL, immigration documents are reviewed because the residence permit application may specify a particular type of activity or business structure.

The gestor personally answers calls, not a manager. Communication is available via WhatsApp, Telegram, email, and phone - questions are answered promptly. Additional services include: obtaining citas at any government institution through professional access (usually within a week), assistance with bank accounts, license processing, notary accompaniment, sworn translations through partners, and registered office address.
