Natalya helps clients at all stages of the immigration process: from initial consultation and strategy development to
document submission and obtaining a positive decision.

She works with all types of residence permits and citizenship processing. She has extensive experience in obtaining
Spanish citizenship for clients and personally went through this entire process. She specializes in Digital Nomad since
the introduction of this residence in Spain and has experience in startup relocation. An important feature of her work
is thorough document verification at every stage, which allows identifying potential issues in advance and protecting
clients from mistakes that can lead to serious consequences.

An additional advantage is working as part of a team with [gestor Lyudmila](#lyudmila-d). This means you can receive
comprehensive support: simultaneously addressing immigration issues (residence permit processing, residence renewal) and
tax matters (autónomo or SL registration, accounting, tax consultations).

Work is conducted with clients both in Spain and those who are still abroad and only planning to relocate.

If you received a rejection of your residence permit, Natalya will help file an appeal, and for court proceedings the
company collaborates with partner lawyers specializing in immigration law. There is successful experience in appealing
rejections and resolving complex immigration cases in court.
