Katerina helps clients at all stages of the immigration process: from initial consultation and strategy development to
document submission and obtaining a positive decision.

She works with all types of residence permits and citizenship processing. She has specialized legal education and has
been handling immigration matters since 2022 — starting at a large consulting firm. Clients appreciate the
responsiveness in communication: the team responds quickly to urgent questions, and during the process a shared chat is
created for convenient communication. An important feature is honest assessment of chances at the start: if the
probability of a positive decision is low, they will tell you right away.

An additional advantage is working as part of a team with [gestor Lyudmila](#lyudmila-d). This means you can receive
comprehensive support: simultaneously addressing immigration issues (residence permit processing, residence renewal) and
tax matters (autónomo or SL registration, accounting, tax consultations).

Work is conducted with clients both in Spain and those who are still abroad and only planning to relocate.

If you received a rejection of your residence permit, Katerina will help file an appeal, and for court proceedings the
company collaborates with partner lawyers specializing in immigration law. There is successful experience in appealing
rejections and resolving complex immigration cases in court.
