Irina has specialized exclusively in immigration matters since 2013. During this time, she has processed all existing types of residence permits and gained experience working with consulates of dozens of countries. The positive decision rate is 96%, with rejections occurring only in rare genuinely risky cases.

One of her strengths is working with complex cases after mistakes by other specialists. Irina knows the specifics of how particular extranjería offices work in different cities: their unique requirements, submission nuances, and typical reasons for rejections. This knowledge comes only from handling a large number of cases.

Clients receive full control over the process: tracking of all documents, transparency at every stage, no need to constantly ask about status. Works with clients both in Spain and abroad. For family and company relocation, there are separate programs, including processing for highly qualified specialists.

In case of rejection, Irina files appeals, and for court proceedings, she collaborates with immigration lawyers.
