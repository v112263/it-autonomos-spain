## Necessary documents for registering an autónomo

1. TIE (or NIE with work permit). If you don't have a residence permit with the right to work yet (Digital Nomad,
   Cuenta Propia, etc.), I recommend contacting [reliable immigration lawyers](#reliable-immigration-lawyers)
   for help with obtaining one.
2. [Spanish bank account](#bank-account-for-autónomo) opened using NIE/DNI (not a passport).
3. Spanish address. Empadronamiento is not required, but the tax agency may require proof if necessary.
4. Spanish phone number.
