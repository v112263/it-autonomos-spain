## Vida Laboral

Informe de Vida Laboral is an official TGSS (Social Security) report showing your history in the social security system,
including your status in the autónomo regime.

Even if you registered as an autónomo just yesterday, the report will already contain all the necessary information. For
the bank, this is sufficient to see that you are officially registered with TGSS and must pay social contributions.
