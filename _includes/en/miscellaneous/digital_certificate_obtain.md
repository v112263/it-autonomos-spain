## Obtaining a digital certificate

A digital certificate in Spain (Certificado Digital) is a digital document that confirms a person's identity. It
allows official interactions with government agencies, banks, the tax office, and other institutions in a secure
manner, without the need for personal presence. It can also be used to sign documents electronically.

If you are autónomo, you **need** a digital certificate. You can apply for it at any time, but it’s better to do it
as soon as possible (even before registering as an autónomo). If you delay obtaining the certificate, you might find
yourself in a situation where you suddenly need it, and then you'll have to get it urgently, likely for a fee.

There are many ways to obtain a digital certificate. Regardless of the method you choose, the certificate will have
the same legal validity. Below are several ways to get it (there are actually more).

**Method #1**

Obtain it through a gestor. Some gestors are accredited to issue personal digital certificates (remotely). This
allows you to get the certificate without leaving your home.

This is one of the fastest methods (if you need it urgently and are willing to pay). If you submit the documents in
the morning, there is a chance to receive the certificate on the same day (if later, the certificate will be ready the
next day). If you don’t have a gestor or if your gestor doesn’t provide this service, you can contact a gestor from
the [reliable gestors section](#reliable-gestors).

**Method #2**

Previously, it was possible to do it for free on [this website](https://certificadoelectronico.es/){:target="_blank"}.
But now, only paid options remain. However, if you don't want to travel and are willing to pay, this is a suitable
option. You will need to upload documents on the website, after which you wait for the certificate to be issued.

**Method #3**

Obtain the certificate at the Ayuntamiento, for free.

1. Go to the website of your Ayuntamiento.
2. Make an appointment (the process might differ slightly depending on the city): CITA PREVIA -> ATENCIÓN AL CIUDADANO -
   OMAC -> Atención al Ciudadano -> OFICINA ATENCION CIUDADANA -> OBTENCIÓN CERTIFICADO DIGITAL ACCV -> Presencial.
3. Bring your documents (at least your TIE) and show up at your Ayuntamiento on the appointment date.
4. Provide your email and phone number.
5. You will receive an sms with a link to a site where you will need to sign on your phone.
6. You will receive an sms with a password to download the certificate.
7. You will receive an email with instructions on how to download the certificate (this can only be done on a computer).

**Method #4**

Get the certificate through [FNMT](https://www.fnmt.es){:target="_blank"} (Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre), for
free.

1. Create a certificate application on the website.
2. Go to one of the authorized centers with your documents to confirm your identity (tax office, Seguridad Social
   office, Ayuntamiento).
