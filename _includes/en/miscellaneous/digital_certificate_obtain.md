## Obtaining a digital certificate

A digital certificate in Spain (Certificado Digital) is your electronic identifier that verifies your identity online.
Essentially, it's one of the most reliable and universal methods of identification - it works practically everywhere.

With a digital certificate, you can:
- interact with government agencies (tax office, social security, Ayuntamiento, etc.);
- sign documents electronically;
- obtain certificates and statements (Vida Laboral, tax declarations, certificates, etc.);
- complete online verification at some banks and services;
- and much more.

Overall, a digital certificate significantly simplifies life in Spain - most issues can be resolved online. The certificate is valid for 4 years, and you can renew it online 60 days before expiration.

If you are autónomo, you **almost certainly need** a digital certificate in practice. But even if you're not autónomo -
I strongly recommend getting one in advance, before you actually need it. When you need the certificate urgently, getting
it in a rush will be more difficult. This way - you can calmly obtain it for free or for a small fee (depending on the method).

There are many ways to obtain a digital certificate. Regardless of the method you choose - the certificate will have the same legal validity. Below are several methods.

**Method #1**

Obtain it through a gestor. Some gestors are accredited to issue personal digital certificates (remotely). This
allows you to get the certificate without leaving your home.

This is one of the fastest methods (if you need it urgently and are willing to pay). If you submit the documents in
the morning, there is a chance to receive the certificate on the same day (if later, the certificate will be ready the
next day). If you don’t have a gestor or if your gestor doesn’t provide this service, you can contact a gestor from
the [reliable gestors section](#reliable-gestors).

**Method #2**

Previously, it was possible to do it for free on [this website](https://certificadoelectronico.es/){:target="_blank"}.
But now, only paid options remain. However, if you don't want to travel and are willing to pay, this is a suitable
option. You will need to upload documents on the website, after which you wait for the certificate to be issued.

**Method #3**

Obtain the certificate at the Ayuntamiento, for free.

1. Go to the website of your Ayuntamiento.
2. Make an appointment (the process might differ slightly depending on the city): CITA PREVIA -> ATENCIÓN AL CIUDADANO -
   OMAC -> Atención al Ciudadano -> OFICINA ATENCION CIUDADANA -> OBTENCIÓN CERTIFICADO DIGITAL ACCV -> Presencial.
3. Bring your documents (at least your TIE) and show up at your Ayuntamiento on the appointment date.
4. Provide your email and phone number.
5. You will receive an sms with a link to a site where you will need to sign on your phone.
6. You will receive an sms with a password to download the certificate.
7. You will receive an email with instructions on how to download the certificate (this can only be done on a computer).

**Method #4**

Get the certificate through [FNMT](https://www.fnmt.es){:target="_blank"} (Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre), for
free.

1. Create a certificate application on the website.
2. Go to one of the authorized centers with your documents to confirm your identity (tax office (AEAT), Seguridad Social
   office, Ayuntamiento, PROP).

**Method #5**

Obtain a certificate through [ACCV](https://www.accv.es/){:target="_blank"} (Agència de Tecnologia i Certificació
Electrònica de la Comunitat Valenciana), online and free of charge (currently, conditions may change).

You will need: TIE (or Spanish driver's license), a Spanish phone number, and an email address.

1. Open the [ACCV website](https://www.accv.es/){:target="_blank"} on your mobile phone.
2. Click the "Obtén certificado" button, then "CIUDADANO".
3. Fill in all your details.
4. Complete the video verification by showing your document to the camera.
5. Wait for approval by email (usually a few hours if submitted during the day).
6. Receive the code and download the certificate to your computer.
