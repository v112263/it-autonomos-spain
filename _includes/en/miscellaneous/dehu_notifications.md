## Electronic notifications from government agencies (DEHú)

**If you are autónomo or have an SL, you are required to receive notifications electronically. The most convenient way to set this up is through DEHú**

[DEHú](https://dehu.redsara.es/){:target="_blank"} is the official portal of the Spanish government for receiving electronic notifications from all government agencies in one place.

Personally, this portal has been useful to me many times, for example when notifications arrived about:

- a fine for apartment repairs;
- taking ownership of [the apartment I bought](#obtaining-a-mortgage-in-spain-for-autónomo-my-experience-and-mistakes);
- expiration of my registration (notification from Ayuntamiento, 2 years after registration);
- various notifications from Seguridad Social;
- various notifications from the tax office.

Through DEHú, practically all types of official notifications from Spanish government agencies are delivered: tax office, immigration service (Extranjería), Seguridad Social, DGT, police, and others. These can be requests for additional documents, decisions on applications, fine notifications, and much more.

This service is useful not only for autónomos and companies, but also for individuals in Spain. It is completely free, and there is also a convenient mobile application.

**How to set up notifications**

1. Go to the [DEHú](https://dehu.redsara.es/){:target="_blank"} website
2. Click the "Acceder" button in the center.
3. Log in using a [digital certificate](#obtaining-a-digital-certificate) (or using other available methods).
4. Go to the "Mis datos de contacto" section and add your email, phone number (you will need to confirm with a code that will be sent to you).
5. Done, now when you receive an electronic notification from any government agency, you will receive an email and SMS. To read the notification, you will need to follow the link and log in using your [digital certificate](#obtaining-a-digital-certificate).

**Important: according to the law, if the recipient does not read their electronic notification within 10 days of its delivery, it is considered delivered automatically (even without your confirmation).**
