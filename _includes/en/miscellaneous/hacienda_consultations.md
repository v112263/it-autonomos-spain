## Official tax authority consultations

Spain has an official
resource [tax consultations database](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/){:target="_blank"}, where
explanations from the General Directorate of Taxes (Dirección General de Tributos) are published. This resource can be useful
if you're facing a disputed or non-standard situation.

**Types of consultations**

*Consultas vinculantes (binding consultations)* - official tax authority responses that are binding for tax authorities regarding
a specific person, if the facts exactly match those described in the request. The tax authority may change its approach in the future,
but if you acted according to the published explanation - this usually protects you from sanctions.

*Consultas generales (general consultations)* - explanatory information without legal force - just general
explanations on tax matters.

**How to use this**

If you encounter a non-standard situation - you can search the database for an official explanation. Here are some interesting
examples of real consultations:

- [V2554-23](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/?num_consulta=V2554-23){:target="_blank"} - can you
  deduct IVA for utilities when working from home. Yes, you can - proportionally to the area used for work.
  An important change in the tax authority's position, which previously didn't allow this.
- [V2594-21](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/?num_consulta=V2594-21){:target="_blank"} - how to work
  with payments from YouTube and Google Ireland: whether you need to register in ROI, how to issue invoices without IVA and fill out
  modelo 349.
- [V1766-22](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/?num_consulta=V1766-22){:target="_blank"} - how
  cryptocurrency staking rewards are taxed. This is not an economic activity, income is taxed as income from
  movable capital (more favorable tax rate).
- [V3625-16](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/?num_consulta=V3625-16){:target="_blank"} - do you need to
  register as autónomo for cryptocurrency mining. Yes, mining is considered an economic activity and requires
  registration under IAE code 831.9 (other financial services).
- [V0507-18](https://petete.tributos.hacienda.gob.es/consultas/?num_consulta=V0507-18){:target="_blank"} - are
  online courses exempt from IVA. If these are downloadable recordings - no, 21% IVA applies; live classes via internet may
  be exempt under certain conditions.

The site has keyword search and filters by tax type (IRPF, IVA) and year.

Personally, I haven't had to search for answers to my questions in this database yet - usually
[consultations with gestors](#reliable-gestors) are enough for me. But if you have a specific question, it makes sense to look for the official
tax authority position.

**Important**: If you want to receive a binding consultation about your specific situation (not just search the database, but
ask your own question), you can submit a request online through the Hacienda portal. The legal response time is up to 6 months, but in
practice there may be delays.

If you've had an interesting experience using this resource - share in the
[chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"} real examples. I'm sure everyone will be interested to read.
