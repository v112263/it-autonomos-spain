**After registration, you need to fill out the form to apply for autónomo registration:**

1. Log in to the Xolo dashboard using the link sent to your email.
2. After logging in, click "Register as Autonomo".
3. Enter your Spanish phone number, then send the verification code.
4. Business Location - Mainland & Balearic Islans or Canary Islands
5. Business activity - for most, "PROGRAMADORES Y ANALISTAS INFORMATICA (763)" will be suitable (but there are many
   other options in the list, choose what fits you).
6. Comments - add your business activity. The accountants can take a look and provide another business code if needed.
7. Tax country - Spain.
8. NIE and Citizenship - your NIE and citizenship.
9. Business address - the address where you will conduct economic activity (business address can be different from where
   you live, this is normal).
10. Referencia catastral - if there is a problem finding by address, you can find your building and apartment on the map
    here and copy the Referencia catastral -
    [Sede Electrónica del Catastro](https://www1.sedecatastro.gob.es/cartografia/mapa.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
11. If after completing these first steps you need to review the information you can click on the «Revise Details»
    button located in the upper right corner of the screen.
12. Civil status - e.g. married or no
13. Social Security Number - if you don't have an NSS, you need to check the box that you don't have it and fill in the
    data (you can check if you have it by logging in here -
    [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
    target="_blank"}).
14. Parents' names - preferably as in the international passports. Also, City of birth, Province of birth, Country of
    birth.
15. Enter IBAN: The bank account has to be Spanish (accepted by the Spanish authorities). See
    the [list of accepted banks by the Tax Office](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/deudas-apremios-embargos-subastas/pagar-aplazar-consultar/listado-entidades-bancarias-adheridas.html?faqId=c2018148e27c2710VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD){:
    target="_blank"}.
16. Forecast of monthly income in EUR - put it as you see it now, income may vary in the future.
17. Forecast of monthly expenses in EUR - can be left empty. Personally, I did not know in advance what my expenses
    would be.
18. I will have customers outside Spain in the EU (for EU VAT registration). I recommend activating this item right
    away. This is in case you have clients in the EU, so you don't have to pay VAT. EU VAT registration takes 1 day.
19. I want to use 7% IRPF on invoices - if you don't have Spanish clients, you don't need to check this box (read more
    in the article [Can I make invoices with 7% IRPF](https://www.xolo.io/es-en/faq/xolo-spain/category/platform/article/can-i-make-invoices-with-7-irpf-personal-income-tax-withhold){:target="_blank"}).
20. Work permit - your TIE (if you don't have a TIE, but have an NIE and Temporary protection, that is also enough; in
    our chat, there are successful cases of opening autónomo through Xolo with only NIE and Temporary protection).
21. I'd like to schedule my registration - if you want to register autónomo now but start activities later (e.g. in a
    couple of months). You can choose the date from which autónomo will be activated (in this case, you can save on
    social contributions if you register autónomo in advance).
22. Total m2 of the house - the exact value can be found
    here [Sede Electrónica del Catastro](https://www1.sedecatastro.gob.es/cartografia/mapa.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
23. Total m2 of working space - the area of your working space (e.g. the area of the room where you will work). Keep in
    mind that by law, you cannot use more than 30% of the apartment area for economic activity. The value you specify in
    this field will be taken into account when deducting apartment rental expenses from taxes (if you decide to deduct
    them).
24. Bank mandate signature. One more thing. Social security registration requires a bank mandate to be filled out and
    signed. We filled it out for you, you just need to sign in the box below.

After filling out the form and completing the identity verification process, you will need
to [pay for the subscription](#subscription-payment).
