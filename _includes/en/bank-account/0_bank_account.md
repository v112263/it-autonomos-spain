# Bank account for autónomo

I strongly recommend reading this entire section carefully, as it is a complex topic with many nuances.

If you want to save time and not read the entire section:

1. Go to a Spanish bank.
2. Open a regular personal account.
3. Don’t mention anything about autónomo when opening the account, you will handle this later.
4. If you already have a personal account in a Spanish bank, use it for autónomo registration.
5. Done, proceed to the next steps for autónomo registration.

If you have any questions, read the information below, where everything is explained in detail.
