## Documents for the bank after autónomo registration

After registering as an autónomo, it is important to notify your bank that you are starting an economic activity and
will receive related payments. This reduces the risk of freezes and last‑minute requests for additional information.

**What to provide and why**

- [**Modelo 036**](#modelo-036): the tax census registration (alta censal). It tells the bank that you officially
  opened your professional activity and will receive professional income.
- [**Informe de Vida Laboral**](#vida-laboral): proves you are registered with Social Security (TGSS) and must pay
  contributions.

In most cases, the bank is satisfied with Modelo 036, but sometimes they also ask for Vida Laboral. Download both in
advance to save time and avoid repeat visits.

**How to provide documents to the bank**

In some banks this can be done online (ask support).

However, I recommend a more reliable approach:

1. Visit a branch.
2. Send the documents to your manager by email in electronic form.
3. Wait until the manager enters the necessary data into the banking system.
4. If you prefer, you can bring printed copies - the manager will scan them.

Sometimes a manager may refuse to enter your data into the system (e.g., “come back when you receive your first
payment as an autónomo”). Do not agree, insist on updating your profile now, otherwise you might have to return later.

**Risks and how to reduce them**

- If you do not update your activity with the bank, the account may be temporarily frozen until your status is
  clarified (this happens in practice).
- The earlier you provide documents and update your profile, the lower the chance of freezes and repeat visits.

**How to verify everything is updated**

After the manager updates your data in the banking system, check the status of your profile in the bank app. There have
been cases where managers assured that everything was done, but the data was not updated, requiring a second visit.

Example for Santander: Menu → Personal Area → Professional details → CNAE/CNO business activity code (should be
“PROFESIONAL LIBERAL O AUTONOMO”), Last profession (your activity, e.g., “ACTIVIDADES DE PROGRAMACION INFORMATICA”).
