## Pushing additional services when opening an account

Unfortunately, in many banks, managers may try to push additional services, such as health insurance. Sometimes,
managers even refuse to open an account unless insurance is purchased from the bank.

This happens because the manager receives a commission for sold banking services.

Don’t rush into getting insurance from the bank, especially if it’s related to your professional activity. There can be
many details that the manager may not know. You may end up with insurance that doesn’t suit you or doesn’t cover damages
as expected. It’s better to consult with insurance specialists.

If you want to build a better relationship with the manager, or if an additional service offers some discounts, you may
consider it. However, if you don’t need these additional services and the manager insists, feel free to file a complaint
with the bank’s support.

For example, I had to take out life insurance and a security system when
I [obtained a mortgage from the bank](https://spainlifeguide.com/en/mortgage/){:target="_blank"}. By
law, this is not mandatory, but before approving the mortgage, the manager insisted on it, and I had no other options
because I really wanted to get the mortgage :)
