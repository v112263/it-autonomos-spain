## Account freezes and deposit limits

**Deposit limits**

1. The smaller the amounts and the less frequent the deposits, the lower the likelihood of issues.
2. Everyone’s experience varies, depending on the specific bank, branch, manager, and other factors.
   In the [chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"}, people mentioned cases where they deposited
   between 5,000 and 10,000 euros at once into Spanish bank accounts without any document requests. However,
   there were also instances where accounts were frozen, requiring a visit to the bank and the provision of additional
   documents. Some cases even involved requests for documents after deposits of a few hundred euros, though these were
   rare exceptions.
3. If you are not working and your total annual deposits amount to around 10,000 euros, the chances of questions from
   the bank or tax authorities are minimal. The tax office’s goal is to find those who evade taxes and impose fines, but
   the fines on small sums would be low and not worth the effort. However, if you are an autónomo and earn, for example,
   20,000-30,000 per year, and you also deposit an additional 10,000 euros in cash at an ATM, this is likely to raise
   questions.

**About account freezes**

1. It’s recommended to notify your bank manager in advance about large transfers or deposits and clarify which documents
   might be needed.
2. When opening an account, the manager may ask about the sums you plan to receive and from which countries. Honest
   answers can reduce the chances of account freezes.
3. Transfers from high-risk countries may increase the likelihood of account freezes.
4. Every year, banks update client information (requesting documents, income sources, place of employment, etc.). If a
   client ignores this request, the bank may remind them several times and then block the account until a personal visit
   and document submission.
5. Try to provide the bank with as many up-to-date documents as possible. Proof of residence, a utility bill, Vida
   Laboral, [Modelo 036](#registration-of-modelo-036-in-the-bank) can all help reduce the chances of a freeze. There
   have been cases where accounts were frozen due to a lack of one of these documents, without any notification (neither
   in the app, by mail, nor via SMS).
6. In any unclear situation, contact your manager or bank support.
