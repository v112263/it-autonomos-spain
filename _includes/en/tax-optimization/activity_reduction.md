### Benefit for new autónomos

*This is one of the most significant tax benefits for autónomos, but unfortunately, not all gestors know about it and not
all of them apply it.*

New autónomos can **reduce by 20%** the amount of net income (profit after deducting expenses) on which
[IRPF](#irpf-income-tax) is paid. This can be done in the first **profitable** tax year, and in the following year. For net
income over 100,000 €, the benefit only applies to the first 100,000 €. If you have other income (salary, rent,
dividends), it does not qualify for this benefit.

To take advantage of this benefit, discuss it with your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) or [Xolo](#xolo-1) when filing
the [annual declaration](#annual-declaration-renta).

Calculation example:

1. Your net profit for the year was 60,000 €.
2. 20% of this amount (12,000 €) will not be subject to IRPF.
3. You will pay IRPF on the remaining 48,000 €.
4. If your effective IRPF rate is ~25% - this will save you 3,000 € per year.

The benefit is available to those who:

1. Use the estimación directa (direct estimation) regime - this is the standard regime for most autónomos.
2. Have not conducted any economic activity for 12 months before the start date of the new activity. Exception: if
   you have already closed your previous activity and during its entire existence it never generated positive net
   profit (even if you closed it less than 12 months ago).
3. In the year of applying the benefit, no more than 50% of income from autónomo activity comes from a former employer
   (you cannot quit and become a contractor for the same company if more than half of your income comes from it).

The benefit applies not just for the first two years after registering as autónomo, but for the first two years from
the moment of making a profit. If the first year was unprofitable - the benefit waits for you until the first profitable
year.

**Why it's better not to register as autónomo at the end of the year**

The benefit is tied not to the registration date, but to the first tax year in which net income became positive, and to
the following year. If you register in November and make a profit in November-December - the first year of applying the
benefit will be this calendar year (even though you only actually worked for a couple of months).

Therefore, if you have the opportunity to start conducting economic activity and receiving income from January - it's
better to do so. Then you will get the full two years of the benefit.

**Activity in other countries**

In the previous year, there should be no economic activity - even in another country and even in a different field.
If you were a sole proprietor outside of Spain in the past year, Hacienda may consider that you are not entitled to
the benefit.

If you claim the benefit but previously conducted activity in another country and declared this income in Spain, in case
of an audit this may lead to additional tax charges and penalties.

**Frequently asked question:** *I worked as a sole proprietor in Ukraine (or another country) and was a programmer, and
now I plan to register as autónomo in Spain and also work as a programmer. Can I use this benefit?*
This has been discussed many times [in the chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"}, search for it
and then make your decision at your own responsibility.

**If the gestor didn't apply the benefit**

If the gestor didn't apply the benefit in the first profitable year, it can still be fixed: ask the gestor to file a
corrective declaration for that year, add the benefit, and get a refund for the overpaid tax. Usually this can be done
within 4 years.

If this is not done, the benefit can be applied in the following year, but it will already count as the second year -
one year of the benefit will be lost.
