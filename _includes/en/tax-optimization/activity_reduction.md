### Benefit for new autónomos

*This is one of the most significant tax benefits for autónomos, but unfortunately, not all gestors know about it and not
all of them apply it.*

New autónomos can **reduce by 20%** the amount of net income (profit after deducting expenses) on which
[IRPF](#irpf-income-tax) is paid. In other words - you can reduce the taxable base by 20%. This can be done in the
first **profitable** tax year, and in the following year. For net income over 100,000 €, the benefit only applies to
the first 100,000 €. If you have other income (salary, rent, dividends), it does not qualify for this benefit.

To take advantage of this benefit, discuss it with your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) or [Xolo](#xolo-1) when filing
the [annual declaration](#annual-declaration-renta).

Calculation example:

1. Your net profit for the year was 60,000 €.
2. If you apply the 20% benefit, you will pay IRPF on 48,000 €, not on 60,000 €.
3. You will save approximately 3,000 € per year (if your effective IRPF rate is ~25%).

The benefit is available to those who:

1. Use the estimación directa (direct estimation) regime - this is the standard regime for most autónomos.
2. Have not conducted economic activity in the year preceding the start date of the new activity. Exception: you
   have ceased your previous activity and during its entire existence it never generated positive net income.
3. In the year of applying the benefit, no more than 50% of income from autónomo activity comes from a former employer
   (you cannot quit and become a contractor for the same company if more than half of your income comes from it).

The benefit **does not apply automatically** during the first two years from the moment of registering as autónomo. It
starts applying in the first year when you make a net profit, and in the following year after that.

**Why it's better not to register as autónomo at the end of the year (or something to consider before registering)**

The benefit is tied not to the registration date, but to the first tax year in which net income became positive, and to
the following year. For example, if you register in November, work only a couple of months until the end of the year, and
finish the year with a net profit (income exceeds expenses), you will use up an entire first year of the benefit (even
though you only actually worked for a couple of months).

Therefore, if you have the opportunity to start conducting economic activity and receiving income from January - then
[register as autónomo](#autónomo-registration-step-by-step) in January.
And you will get the full two years of the benefit.

**Activity in other countries**

In the previous year, there should be no economic activity - even in another country and even in a different field.
If you were a sole proprietor outside of Spain in the past year, Hacienda may consider that you are not entitled to
the benefit.

If you claim the benefit but previously conducted activity in another country and declared this income in Spain, in case
of an audit this may lead to additional tax charges and penalties.

**Frequently asked question:** *I worked as a sole proprietor in Ukraine (or another country) and was a programmer, and
now I plan to register as autónomo in Spain and also work as a programmer. Can I use this benefit?*
This has been discussed many times [in the chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"}, search for it
and then make your decision at your own responsibility.

**If the gestor didn't apply the benefit**

If the gestor didn't apply the benefit in the first profitable year, it can still be fixed: ask the gestor to file a
corrective declaration for that year, add the benefit, and get a refund for the overpaid tax. Usually this can be done
within 4 years.

If this is not done, the benefit can be applied in the following year, but it will already count as the second year -
and the first year of the benefit will be lost.
