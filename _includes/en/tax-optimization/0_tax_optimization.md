# Tax optimization

The Spanish tax system provides fully legal mechanisms for optimizing the tax burden for autónomos.
All optimization methods described in this section are legal and officially provided by Spanish tax
legislation.

The main optimization mechanism is tax deductions, which allow autónomos to reduce their taxable base through
certain expenses related to professional activity (e.g., office rent, equipment purchases,
service subscriptions). In addition, there are special tax benefits and discounts.

**If you have doubts** that your gestor is applying all necessary deductions and benefits, or you want to make sure you're not missing anything:
1. You can send them a link to this section and ask them to apply all deductions and benefits that are applicable to you.
2. Or you can contact [reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors) who know all these nuances and can apply the necessary deductions.
