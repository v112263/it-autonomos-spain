### Electricity

If the contract with the electricity provider is not signed by you, you will not be able to deduct these expenses. In my
experience, the procedure for transferring the contract is quite simple (just contact support, and they will help you do
it).

To deduct this, you need to provide your gestor with a full invoice that meets the [requirements](#invoice-requirements).
