### Waste tax

If you decide to deduct rent, water supply, and electricity from taxes, you will likely need to pay the waste tax.

The waste tax is a municipal tax charged for waste collection and disposal. It may be proportional to the area
used for professional activity.

It is difficult to say in advance whether you will need to pay this tax, because it depends on the specific
municipality. It even happens that in one city, some people need to pay this tax, while others do not.

On average, waste tax is 91 euros per year.
