### Autónomo Colaborador

Autónomo Colaborador is a status granted to family members of an autónomo who work in their business. Typically,
this status is used by spouses, children (over 16 years old), or parents. This status allows for tax optimization,
potentially reducing the tax burden.

It is important that the family member actually engages in professional activities in the business. Attempting to
use this status for fictitious tax optimization, when the spouse is not involved in the work, may raise questions
from the tax authorities.

I plan to describe this optimization scheme in more detail later: how exactly it works, how to register Autónomo
Colaborador, and other details. If you need help in the near future, you can consult with
[reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors) for now.
