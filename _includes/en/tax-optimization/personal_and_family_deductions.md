### Personal and family tax benefits

When filing the [annual tax return (Renta)](#annual-declaration-renta), you can reduce your tax through personal and family circumstances - having children, elderly parents, disability. There are state (basic) allowance amounts, but some autonomous communities set their own (usually higher) allowances for the regional part of IRPF.

All amounts in this section are valid for filing the 2024 tax return. When filing for other years, amounts may differ - check current information on the [Agencia Tributaria](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/manuales-practicos.html){:target="_blank"} website.

Family benefits are divided into two categories:
- **Personal and family allowance** - reduces the tax base
- **Tax credits** - deducted directly from the tax amount

#### How the allowance works

Each taxpayer has a basic allowance of €5,550 per year that is not taxed (this is the state rate - some autonomous communities set higher values). Amounts for children, parents, and disability are added to this.

For example, if you have one child under 3 years old, your allowance will be: €5,550 (basic) + €2,400 (for child) + €2,800 (for child under 3) = €10,750. You don't pay [IRPF](#irpf-income-tax) on this amount.

The allowance reduces the tax base, not the tax itself. This means savings depend on your tax rate. At a 30% rate, savings from a €2,400 allowance will be approximately €720.

#### Allowance for children

Amounts added to your allowance for each child:

- €2,400 - first child
- €2,700 - second child
- €4,000 - third child
- €4,500 - fourth and each subsequent
- +€2,800 additional for each child under 3 years old

Requirements for applying the allowance:
- Child is under 25 years old on December 31 of the tax year (or any age with 33% or higher disability)
- Child's annual income doesn't exceed €8,000 (excluding non-taxable income)
- Child doesn't file their own return with income over €1,800
- Child lives with you or is economically dependent on you

If both parents are entitled to this allowance (e.g., both file separately), the amount is divided equally between them.

#### Allowance for parents

If your parents live with you, you can add to your allowance:

- €1,150 for each parent over 65 years old
- +€1,400 additional if the parent is over 75 years old (total €2,550)

Requirements:
- Parent is over 65 years old (or any age with 33% or higher disability)
- Parent's annual income doesn't exceed €8,000
- Parent doesn't file their own return with income over €1,800
- Parent lives with you for at least half the year

If several children support one parent, the allowance is divided equally among them.

#### Disability allowance

Additional amounts to the allowance for disability (applies to the taxpayer, children, or parents):

- €3,000 for disability from 33% to 65%
- €9,000 for disability 65% and above
- +€3,000 additional if assistance is required or mobility is limited

#### Joint filing

When filing jointly, an additional tax base reduction applies - €3,400 for official marriage or €2,150 for single-parent family (one parent with children).

When it's beneficial to file jointly:
- One spouse doesn't work or has very low income
- Allows offsetting one spouse's losses with the other's income
- There are expenses that are more beneficial to account for jointly

If both spouses work and have significant income, it's better to file separately. Joint filing may result in a higher tax rate due to the progressive scale.

With joint filing, the basic allowance (€5,550) is not doubled - it applies once per family, not per spouse.

With a registered domestic partnership (pareja de hecho), you cannot file jointly as official spouses - the tax authority doesn't recognize domestic partnerships as a family unit for these purposes. Technically, one partner can file a return with the children, but the €2,150 base reduction doesn't apply if the partners live together (which is the typical case). The law explicitly states: the reduction doesn't apply when the taxpayer lives with the other parent of the children.

#### Maternity tax credit

Unlike the allowance, this tax credit is subtracted directly from the tax amount, making it particularly beneficial.

Amount: up to €1,200 per year (€100 per month) for each child under 3 years old. Additionally, you can receive up to €1,000 per year for childcare expenses - totaling up to €2,200 per year per child.

Who is eligible:
- Women with children under 3 who were registered with [Seguridad Social](#seguridad-social) at the time of birth or receiving unemployment benefits
- For autónomo, this means you must be registered as autónomo

To receive the additional €1,000 for childcare, the center must be authorized and submit form Modelo 233 to the tax authority with information about your expenses. Be sure to check with your childcare center whether they submit this form.

How to receive:
- You can receive it in advance at €100 per month by submitting Modelo 140
- Or apply it when filing the [annual Renta return](#annual-declaration-renta) (will reduce tax due or increase refund amount)

The maternity tax credit is incompatible with the child supplement under the minimum living income program (Ingreso Mínimo Vital).

#### Large families tax credit

This is also a tax credit that is subtracted directly from the tax amount. To receive it, you need an official large family certificate from your autonomous community.

- Up to €1,200 per year for the general category (3-4 children)
- Up to €2,400 per year for the special category (5+ children or 4 children under certain conditions)
- +€600 for each child above the minimum for the corresponding category

You can receive it when filing the annual Renta return or in advance by submitting the corresponding application to the tax authority. If several family members are entitled to the tax credit, the amount is divided equally among them, or the right can be transferred to one family member.

#### Practical calculation example

Let's say you have a family: you're an autónomo, your spouse doesn't work, two children (4 years old and 1 year old), and your mother lives with you (70 years old, no income).

Allowance:
- Basic: €5,550
- First child: €2,400
- Second child: €2,700
- Child under 3: €2,800
- Mother (65+): €1,150
- Total allowance: **€14,600**

Base reduction for joint filing: €3,400

Maternity tax credit (if spouse meets requirements): up to €1,200 directly from tax

The exact savings calculation depends on your income and tax rate. I recommend discussing with a [gestor](#reliable-gestors) which option is more beneficial - joint or separate filing.
