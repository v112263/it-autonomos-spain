### Medical insurance

You can deduct expenses for health insurance (500 euros per year for yourself and the same amount for family members
under 25 years old).

I do not deduct this because I only use public healthcare in Spain (healthcare here is one of the best in the world).

To deduct this, you need to provide your gestor with a full invoice that meets the [requirements](#invoice-requirements).
