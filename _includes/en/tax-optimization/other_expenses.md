### Other professional expenses

You can deduct other expenses related to professional activities from your taxes.

For example:

- Subscription to the IDE you use (e.g., IntelliJ);
- Subscription to ChatGPT (if used for work);
- Training courses;
- Professional insurance - civil liability insurance, office or equipment insurance;
- And many others, as long as you can justify them.

An important point is that all these expenses must be necessary for your professional activity.

To deduct this, you need to provide your gestor with a full invoice that meets the [requirements](#invoice-requirements).
