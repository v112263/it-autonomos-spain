### Withholdings (retenciones)

If you use professional services (such as lawyers, consultants, engineers, and other specialists) or
rent commercial premises, you may receive invoices with tax withholding (retención).

They only apply to invoices intended for corporate or autónomo buyers in Spain, and only companies or autónomos with
certain IAE activity types (mainly personal professional services) are required to include such withholdings in their
invoices.

**What are retenciones**

Retención is an amount that your client withholds and transfers to the tax authority (or you yourself, if you act as
a client). It represents an advance payment on income tax (IRPF) and reduces the amount of tax you will have to pay by
year end.

In simple terms: retención is part of your income that the client does not pay you directly, but gives to the tax
authority towards your IRPF.

For example: You issue an invoice to a client for 1000 EUR. It shows retención 15% - the client will transfer 850 EUR to you, and 150 EUR
will be sent to Hacienda on your behalf.

Then, when you file your [annual declaration](#annual-declaration-renta), this advance is credited - part of your
income tax has already been paid on your behalf.

**Withholding rates**

Standard retenciones rates:

- 7% - for new professionals during the first 3 years of activity
- 15% - standard rate for professional services after 3 years
- 19% - for commercial property rental

**What to do with invoices with retenciones**

- If you receive invoices with withholding (for example, from a lawyer or landlord), pass them to
  your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) so they can correctly record the withheld amounts.
- If you issue invoices with retención (for example, to corporate clients in Spain), make sure you indicate the correct
  rate and that the client will transfer the withheld tax to Hacienda.
- Submit such invoices on time to avoid penalties and reporting errors.
