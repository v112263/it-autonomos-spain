### Withholdings (retenciones)

If you use professional services (such as lawyers, consultants, engineers, and other specialists) or
rent commercial premises, you may receive invoices with tax withholding (retención).

**What are retenciones**

Retención is a tax that your client withholds and transfers to the tax authority (or you yourself, if you act as
a client). It represents an advance payment on income tax (IRPF) and reduces the amount of tax that will need
to be paid at the end of the year.

In simple terms: retención is part of your income that the client does not pay you directly, but gives to the tax authority as
an advance on your IRPF.

For example: You issue an invoice to a client for 1000 EUR. It shows retención 15% - the client will transfer 850 EUR to you, and 150 EUR
will be sent to Hacienda on your behalf.

Then, when you file your annual declaration, this advance is credited - you have already partially paid the tax.

**Withholding rates**

Standard retenciones rates:

- 7% - for new professionals during the first 3 years of activity
- 15% - standard rate for professional services after 3 years
- 19% - for commercial property rental

**What to do with invoices with retenciones**

- If you receive invoices with withholding (for example, from a lawyer or landlord), pass them to
  your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) so they can correctly record the withheld amounts.
- If you issue invoices with retención (for example, to corporate clients), make sure you indicate the correct rate and that the client will transfer the withheld tax to Hacienda.
- Submit such invoices on time to avoid penalties and reporting errors.
