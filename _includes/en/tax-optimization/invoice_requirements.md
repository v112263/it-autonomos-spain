### Invoice requirements

To deduct expenses from taxes, you need to provide invoices (full invoices) to your [gestor](#reliable-gestors)
or upload them to the Xolo dashboard.

**What should be in the invoice:**

- Your NIE
- Your full name
- Autónomo registration address
- Description of the service or product
- Amount and date

Without this data, the invoice will not be accepted for tax deduction.

**Common mistake**

According to [gestors](#reliable-gestors), the most common mistake clients make is sending not invoices, but just
receipts (ticket) or incomplete invoices that don't contain all the required data. Then clients wonder why a certain
deduction wasn't applied. I recommend paying close attention to this and sending the correct documents to your gestor
for deductions.

**Invoice language**

It is recommended to provide invoices in Spanish. This will help avoid potential difficulties during inspection
by tax authorities. If invoices are in another language, they may need to be translated into Spanish in case of
an audit.

**Bank statements instead of invoices**

In some cases, bank statements can be used instead of invoices. For example, to confirm payment of rent, utilities,
or social contributions. I have indicated this separately in the relevant articles below.

But for most professional expenses (equipment purchases, service subscriptions, specialist services) an invoice
is mandatory.
