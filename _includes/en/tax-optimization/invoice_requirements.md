### Invoice requirements

To claim expenses and pay less taxes, you need to provide invoices (full invoices) to your [gestor](#reliable-gestors)
or upload them to the Xolo dashboard.

**What should be in the invoice:**

- The word "Factura" or "Invoice" and a sequential number
- Your DNI/NIE/CIF
- Your full name or company name
- Autónomo or company registration address
- Description of the service or product (the expense must be related to your economic activity)
- Amount and date
- Seller's details (company name, DNI/NIE/CIF/tax or registration number, address)

If some data is missing from the invoice, it may cause problems with the tax authorities in case of an audit
of such expenses. It's also important to understand that IVA can only be reclaimed from complete invoices with all data.

**Common mistake**

According to [gestors](#reliable-gestors), the most common mistake clients make is sending not invoices, but just
receipts (ticket, receipt, factura proforma) or incomplete invoices that don't contain all the required data. Then
clients wonder why a certain deduction wasn't applied. I recommend paying close attention to this and sending the
correct documents to your gestor for deductions.

**Invoice language**

It is recommended to provide invoices in Spanish. This will help avoid potential difficulties during inspection
by tax authorities. If invoices are in another language, they may need to be translated into Spanish in case of
an audit.

**Bank receipts instead of invoices**

In some cases, bank payment receipts can be used instead of invoices. For example, to confirm payment of rent,
social contributions, salaries, professional insurance payments for your activity, bank expenses and fees,
IBI for premises (where the activity is conducted), IAE, as well as other local and state fees. I have indicated
this separately in the relevant articles below.

But for most professional expenses (equipment purchases, service subscriptions, specialist services) an invoice
is mandatory.
