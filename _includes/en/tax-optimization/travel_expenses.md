### Flights, hotels, and train tickets

If you're traveling on a business trip to a client, to a professional conference, exhibition, or other business event, you can deduct these expenses from your taxes. But you need to be able to justify the business purpose of the trip if Hacienda asks.

Examples of justification:
- A contract with a client from that country
- An invitation letter from a client
- Business correspondence where you arrange the visit
- A specific purpose for the visit (meeting, negotiations, contract signing, etc.)
- Tickets or invitation letters for a conference/exhibition

For business travel expenses, it's better to pay electronically (card/transfer/Bizum) because it's easier to prove the expense.
You also need to get a [full invoice](#invoice-requirements) for the deduction. It's better to plan trips on working
days - expenses on weekends or holidays can be deducted, but Hacienda may scrutinize them more closely.

If a flight ticket or hotel invoice lists someone else's name besides yours (for example, your spouse's), you can't deduct anything for your spouse - only for yourself. Your gestor should carefully review the invoice and deduct only the amount that can be correctly deducted.

Domestic flights within Spain, train tickets, and hotels are subject to 10% IVA, and this IVA can be deducted. International
flights are exempt from IVA, but the expense still reduces your IRPF base. A flight ticket by itself is not an invoice -
you need to request a full invoice from the airline. If you book through an agency - many of them don't itemize IVA on
the invoice, in which case an IVA deduction is not possible (but you can still deduct IRPF).

In practice, some gestors don't deduct IVA for hotels because Hacienda pays extra attention to these expenses.
