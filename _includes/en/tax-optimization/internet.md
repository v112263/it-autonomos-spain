### Internet

If the contract with the internet provider is not signed by you, you will not be able to deduct these expenses. In my
experience, the procedure for transferring the contract is quite simple (just contact support, and they will help you do
it).

To claim the deduction, you need to provide your gestor with a full invoice that meets the [requirements](#invoice-requirements).
