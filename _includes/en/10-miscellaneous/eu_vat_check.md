## Checking the validity of the EU VAT number

If you have consciously decided not to register an EU VAT number, you can skip this information.

If during the registration of your autónomo you also registered for an EU VAT number (by selecting the appropriate
option in Xolo or by asking your gestor), you should have received a notification in your tax agency personal area 
about 1-2 days later stating that your EU VAT number has been successfully registered.

If you haven't registered for an EU VAT number yet - no problem, contact [Xolo support](#support-contacts) or your 
gestor, and they will promptly handle everything.

After registering the EU VAT, log in to your [tax agency personal area](#notifications-from-the-tax-office) to check the
notifications, and download the document "AEAT ACUERDO DE ALTA EN EL REGISTRO DE OPERADORES INTRACOMUNITARIOS". In this
document, you will find your EU VAT number under "Su Número de operador intracomunitario a efectos de IVA es".
