## Annual declaration (Renta)

The annual Renta declaration (Modelo 100) in Spain is a personal income tax declaration for the year. It is submitted
to calculate and pay income tax ([IRPF](#irpf-income-tax)), taking into account salaries, income from self-employment,
rentals, investments, and other sources. The declaration can result in either an additional tax payment or a refund (if
you
overpaid taxes during the year). The submission period usually runs from early April to the end of June. For example,
the declaration for 2024 must be submitted from early April 2025 to the end of June 2025.

**If you need help with submitting your Renta or don't want to do it through your gestor, you can contact
[gestors from the list of reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors)**.

To maximize your tax savings, I strongly recommend reading this entire section, as well as studying all the links I've
provided,
before you submit your Renta. It's important to understand that no gestor, regardless of how much you pay them,
can take care of your interests as well as you can yourself.

### Who must submit a Renta declaration?

Renta must be submitted **not only by autónomos**. It must be submitted by all individuals who meet
certain criteria. In some cases, it's mandatory to submit it even if you don't work.

I'll provide a general example below. However, the exact information should be checked on the tax authority's website
for the specific year
for which the declaration is being submitted. For 2024, you can check
here - [Delimitación de la obligación de declarar en el IRPF](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/ayuda/manuales-videos-folletos/manuales-practicos/irpf-2024/c01-campana-declaracion-renta/quienes-estan-obligados-presentar-declaracion-irpf/delimitacion-obligacion-declarar-irpf.html),
and for 2025, it should be published later.

You must submit a Renta declaration if during the reporting year you had:

- Work income over €22,000 per year from a single employer.
- Work income over €15,876 per year if you have 2 or more employers, and one of them paid more than €1,500.
- Benefits or social assistance: ERTE, payments from the city council, subsidies, etc.
- Rental income: if you rented out property and earned more than €1,000.
- Income from abroad.
- If bank interest, income from stocks or cryptocurrencies exceeds €1,600, or capital gains exceeded €1,000.

**Also, all autónomos are required to submit a Renta declaration without exception, regardless of income level (even if
it was zero).**

If you were required to submit a declaration but didn't, there **will be a penalty**. The more serious your violation,
the larger
the penalty (for a minor violation, the penalty may be €100-200).

I have personally heard of examples where a person was living peacefully, not working, and then at some point, it turned
out that
they needed to have submitted a Renta declaration the previous year. The good news is that penalties in these situations
are usually small.

### The Renta submission process

The submission process looks the same for both [gestors](#reliable-gestors) and [Xolo](#xolo-1). In most cases, this is
a separate paid service.

If you submit your Renta through your gestor who already handles your accounting, they will already have some of the
documents. If
you submit through another gestor, you will need to provide invoices for your autónomo income, expense invoices,
etc.

You will also receive a questionnaire that needs to be carefully completed. All questions must be answered
as honestly as possible, without forgetting anything. If you have doubts, don't hesitate to clarify with your gestor -
at this stage, this is
preliminary data collection in preparation for submitting the declaration.

I've provided an approximate list of questions with important nuances below. It may differ among different gestors, but
in general, it will be
very similar. When answering the questions, provide information for the reporting year. For example, if in 2025 you're
submitting
a Renta for 2024, provide data that was current from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.
Some factors can reduce the tax amount (for example, having children, submitting a joint declaration).

**Questions:**

- Your contact information.
- Were you in Spain for more than 183 days of the year?
- Do you want to submit a joint declaration with your spouse? (not available for Pareja de hecho) - *This is more
  advantageous
  if one spouse has low or zero income.*
- Do you have children who are legally dependent on you?
- Types of income you had during the year (employment, autonomo, profits/losses from capital gains,
  government benefits, pension, subsidies/other grants, other)
- Did you sell or buy real estate during the year?
- Did you rent out property during the year?
- How many real estate properties were registered in your name in Spain and other countries during the year?
- Did you have assets of any kind (money in bank accounts, cash, real estate, cars, jewelry,
  insurance policies, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) in foreign countries or Spain, and did the total value of all
  assets
  exceed **€50,000** excluding your primary residence? - *For example, if you have an account with Interactive Brokers
  with
  €10k, plus cryptocurrencies worth €10k, and additionally a small apartment worth €25k,
  the total is €45k - which means there's nothing to declare (because the total is less than €50k).*
- Did you have assets of any kind (money in bank accounts, cash, real estate, cars, jewelry,
  insurance policies, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) in foreign countries or Spain, and did the total value of all
  assets
  exceed **€500,000** excluding your primary residence? - *This question is similar to the previous one but affects the
  submission of
  an additional Modelo.*
- Did you receive donations/inheritance?
- Did you use the Beckham Law?
- Did you buy or sell stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, or other financial assets?
- IBAN for tax deduction.
- Do you have a [digital certificate](#obtaining-a-digital-certificate)/cl@ve/declaration from the previous year?
- Do you pay taxes in other countries? - *For cases of double taxation.*
- Did you start a new activity in the reporting year? - *For new entrepreneurs,
  there is a [special 20% discount](#reducción-por-inicio-de-una-actividad-económica), not all gestors know about this.
  To
  apply this discount, you need to meet certain criteria.*

Your [gestor](#reliable-gestors) will consult with you on any questions you may have, to help you complete the
questionnaire as accurately as possible. Also, for some questions, you may need to provide the gestor with additional
data or
documentary evidence.

After receiving the information, the gestor will calculate the tax base and the IRPF amount. They will apply all
eligible [deductions and benefits](#tax-deductions-and-benefits), and
also take into account the net profit from your business (income minus documented expenses).

After completing the questionnaire and all agreements, you will be sent a draft version for review, which will indicate
all
calculations and the final tax amount. After your review and confirmation, the declaration will be sent to the tax
authorities.
After calculating the declaration, you will be informed of the results – the tax amount to be paid or refunded.

### Tax deduction

After sending the final declaration to the tax authorities, the gestor will inform you of the tax deduction date. You
can request in advance
to arrange the tax payment in two parts (60% will be deducted at the end of June, and 40% in November). Payment in two
parts will be without commission and without any hidden issues. Later, the tax authorities will either deduct funds from
the specified account (in
case of underpayment of taxes) or return the overpayment (within 6 months).

Make sure that the required amount is in the account, otherwise problems may arise.

### How to reduce your tax?

When submitting the Renta, your gestor will already have some of the necessary documents for applying tax deductions.
For example, if an
autónomo makes purchases for their business and deducts them from the taxable base, they provide these documents to the
gestor regularly throughout the year. However, there are other deductions that are applied at the final stage of
submitting the
declaration and require separate discussion.

Therefore, I recommend **carefully reviewing the
section on [tax deductions and benefits](#tax-deductions-and-benefits)** again, and applying everything you can to
reduce the tax
amount.

### Regional tax deductions

This is a more complex topic, and it's unlikely that any gestors will be able to help you effectively with this (there
are many nuances, and they
differ for each province). Be sure to read the section on [regional deductions](#regional-deductions) to
maximize your tax savings.

### Types of Modelo submitted with Renta

Initially, Renta refers to Modelo 100 (IRPF tax declaration). In addition, gestors submit other Modelo forms depending
on your answers to the questions.

**Modelo 720** - declaration of foreign assets. This is an informational declaration submitted by tax residents of
Spain if they own foreign assets worth more than €50,000 (bank accounts, real estate, securities,
etc.). This declaration does not involve paying tax, but the tax authorities receive data about your foreign assets.
After the first submission of Modelo 720, it only needs to be updated if the amounts increase by more than €20,000 or if
new assets appear.

**Modelo 721** - declaration of crypto assets abroad. A report introduced in 2024 for residents who own
cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges. Similar to Modelo 720, but only concerns cryptocurrencies. Mandatory to submit if
crypto assets on foreign platforms exceed €50,000 at the end of the year.

**Modelo 714** - wealth tax declaration (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio). Must be submitted if the net
value of the taxpayer's property exceeds €700,000 (or €2,000,000 in gross assets, even if the tax payable
is zero). Includes real estate, bank accounts, investments, cars, jewelry, and other assets.

Other Modelo forms may also be submitted.

An important nuance about Modelo 720: For example, if a tax resident of Spain indicates in Modelo 720 an apartment
purchased before
obtaining residency, then when selling it in the future, they may avoid capital gains tax (in some cases).
Therefore, indicate in advance all assets you own. If this nuance is important to you, it's better to discuss it in
advance
with a [gestor](#reliable-gestors).

### Make sure your gestor is doing everything correctly

If your gestor's Renta submission process differs significantly from what's described above, it makes sense to clarify
the
details with them. Some gestors may ask few questions and mainly rely on the Renta draft in the tax office portal
(which is automatically generated based on data that the tax authorities were able to obtain). However, it may be
missing
important information, especially if you have a complex tax situation (for example, income from autónomo activities,
rentals, or
asset sales).

If the gestor doesn't take into account all the necessary information, this can lead to problems - from correcting the
declaration to penalties.

### Do you need to submit your Renta as soon as possible?

In some situations, such as
when [obtaining a mortgage](#obtaining-a-mortgage-in-spain-for-autónomo-my-experience-and-mistakes) or
a loan, you may need to submit your Renta as soon as possible. In this case, try to arrange with your gestor for
an urgent submission of the declaration.

### How to save on filing your Renta?

You can submit your Renta through Xolo, your gestor, or any other gestor.

If you use Xolo and plan to file a joint declaration with your spouse, note that you'll need to purchase the Renta
filing service for each of you separately. There is a 20% discount for the second Renta.

I recommend calculating in advance how much filing your Renta will cost. If the cost through Xolo turns out to be high,
it's worth [comparing with offers from other gestors](#reliable-gestors), as some may have lower prices.
