## Checking filed tax declarations

All tax declarations that you submit (or that a gestor submits on your behalf) are stored by the tax authority. They can
be accessed online through your personal account on the Agencia Tributaria website. This can be useful for all taxpayers
in Spain (not just for autónomos):

- You can check whether the necessary tax declarations have actually been submitted and registered with Agencia
  Tributaria on time.
- If you are planning to [obtain a mortgage](https://spainlifeguide.com/en/mortgage/){:target="_blank"}
  or bank loans, you may need to provide tax returns.
- In other situations, such as proving income, paid taxes, applying for social benefits, or obtaining a residence
  permit.
