# Autónomo and SL Spain Documentation Project

## Project Overview
This is a Jekyll-based multilingual documentation website about being an autónomo or SL in Spain. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages and provides comprehensive guidance in multiple languages.

## Key Principles

### Multilingual First
- All content must be available in Russian, Ukrainian, English, and Spanish
- Maintain consistency across all language versions
- Russian serves as the primary source language

### Content Quality
- Provide accurate, up-to-date information about Spanish autonomo and SL
- Maintain professional tone and clear explanations
- Include practical examples and real-world guidance
- Use the author's distinctive voice: conversational, practical, and experience-based

### Technical Standards
- Follow Jekyll best practices
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility
- Optimize for search engines and user experience

## Development Workflow
When making changes:
1. Update content in the primary language (usually Russian)
2. Ensure corresponding translations are updated
3. Verify all navigation and links work across languages

## File Organization
- Use consistent directory structure across languages
- Store shared assets in `_includes/common/`
- Maintain clear separation between content and presentation
