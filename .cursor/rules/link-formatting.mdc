# Link Formatting Standards

## Internal Links
Use Jekyll liquid tags for internal links to ensure proper path resolution:

```markdown
{% link path/to/file.md %}
```

### Benefits
- Automatic path resolution
- Build-time link validation
- Consistent URL generation across environments

## External Links  
Use standard Markdown format with target attribute for external links:

```markdown
[text](mdc:url){:target="_blank"}
```

### Requirements
- Always include `{:target="_blank"}` for external links
- Ensures links open in new tabs/windows
- Improves user experience and site retention

## Best Practices
- Verify all internal links use Jekyll liquid syntax
- Test link functionality across all language versions
- Maintain consistent link formatting throughout the site
- Use descriptive link text for accessibility
