# Language Priority for Partner/Gestor Profiles

## Principle

**Order the partner’s languages by their relevance to the audience of the current site-language version.**

## Algorithm

1. **First**: Place the current site language, if the partner speaks it.
2. **If the partner does not speak the site language**: start with the **most relevant** language for that audience (by proximity/usage).
3. **Then**: List the remaining languages in decreasing order of relevance for that audience. If relevance is indistinguishable, sort them alphabetically (or by a stable internal order).

## How to assess “relevance”

Use these heuristics (no hardcoded language pairs):

- **Linguistic proximity** to the current site language (mutual intelligibility, same language group, etc.).
- **Geographic / sociolinguistic proximity** (co-official or widely used languages in the same region).
- **Expected usefulness for this audience** (languages the audience is most likely to know as L2).
- **Global lingua francas** come **after** close/regional languages for that audience.

## Implementation Notes

- Apply the same principle consistently across all partners and site versions.
- Do **not** encode fixed per-version exceptions; always compute the order via the principles above.
- If relevance cannot be determined due to lack of data, put the site language first (if applicable) and sort the rest alphabetically.
