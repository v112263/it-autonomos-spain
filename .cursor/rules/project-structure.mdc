# Project Structure Guidelines

This is a Jekyll-based website about being an autónomo and SL in Spain, deployed on GitHub Pages with multilingual support.

## Directory Structure

### Index Files
- `index.md` - Main English index page
- `ru/index.md` - Russian index page
- `ua/index.md` - Ukrainian index page
- `es/index.md` - Spanish index page

These files contain links to all articles for each respective language.

### Language Directories
Root-level language-specific directories:
- `en/` - English content
- `ru/` - Russian content
- `ua/` - Ukrainian content
- `es/` - Spanish content

### Article Storage
Most articles are stored in language-specific include directories:
- `_includes/en/` - English articles
- `_includes/ru/` - Russian articles
- `_includes/ua/` - Ukrainian articles
- `_includes/es/` - Spanish articles

## Content Organization
- Each language maintains the same structure and organization
- Articles are organized by topic in subdirectories within each language folder
- Index files serve as navigation hubs linking to all available articles
